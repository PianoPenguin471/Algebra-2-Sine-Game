# Guess that sine
## Project for Ms. McGinley's Algebra 2 class
### Use the information you have been given to reconstruct the sine wave equation

## TODO:
- [x] Randomly generate sine wave
- [x] Gather user input
- [x] Compare user input to existing wave
- [ ] Reward user if successful

## Nice to have
- Leaderboard for players who guessed correctly the most
- Make leaderboard display if hints were used and how many
- Fiddle with CSS to make it look bearable without dark reader
